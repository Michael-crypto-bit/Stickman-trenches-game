# Stickman-trenches-game
v1.0:
unfinished, but has core features, 4 different troops:                                             
    -Regular stick figure rifleman - has issue with walking animation, and targeting within a trench                                    
    -Stick figure mortar - has issue with walking animation, and targetting within a trench, mortar shells do not hit the ground                               
    -Tank doesn't attack yet
    -jeep doesn't attack and the design is ridiculous
    -stick figure troops don't wait for a trench to be cleared before claiming it                                                            
v1.1 should be around soon                                                                                            
line.html is another branch that is unused and not posted, but is a fun game nonetheless
